Let the instance be: 2 vCPU | 4 GB
Set Hostname: SHIPEX-Server
Instead SSH key use password
user: root
password: Obumneke@25


Then please recharge it. if the '2 vCPU | 4 GB' is much costly to you then you can use the '1 vCPU | 2 GB' one only in that case.




SSH key setup:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "leonardbobby0@gmail.com"
